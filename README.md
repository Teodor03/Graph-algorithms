# Graph-algorithms
This repository contains a collection of implementations of the most commonly used algorithms for solving various graph problems.
The implementations are organized in the following groups:
# Simple problems
1.Connected components, bridges, articulations points - A collection of algorithms for solving simple problems.
2.Topological sort
# Shortest-path related problems
3.Single source shortest path - Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Zero-one BFS
4.All pairs shortest path - Floyd-Warshall
# Tree related problems
5.Spanning trees - Kruskal and Prim algorithms for minimum spanning tree.
6.Lowest common ancestor (LCA) - The most commonly used implementation (and extremely fast) with Euler path and sparse table.
7.Queries on a tree - Implementations of heavy-light decomposition and centroid decomposition.
# Maximum flow
8.Max Flow - Implementations of the Edmand-Karp and Dinic algorithms for maximum flow + implementation of the algorithm for solving Min-cost flow using SPFA.
